# CA2 Initial Thoughts
# Tasks:
# Create user interface and board
# Initially a 2 player game
# Handle user input
# playe1 move
# player2 move
# winner?
# draw?
# AI implementation - choose algorithm!
# pylint?
#
# Clean up code continiously before every commit
# Comments - function comments etc before every commit
